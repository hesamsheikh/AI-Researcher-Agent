## 🚀Let's build 𝐀𝐈 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 to read a research paper and write a blog post for it: (100% 𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲) 

We will create AI Agents that:
📖 Read a scientific paper
✍ Write a blog post about it
🏷️ Choose a great title for the post
I will use Lightning AI for fast and easy development and Ollama for running AI 100% locally, no API is needed! 

We will use OpenHermes, a state-of-the-art model fine-tuned on Mistral,
🪶 It is lightweight, (7B)
👍 It works great with agentic instructions
To setup our LLM:
- Setup Ollama,
- Pull the model,
- Initiate it.

Let's create a tool for reading the paper in PDF format and to return the contents of it. Our Agent will use this tool later... 📄

We create three agents:
🤖 Reads paper
🤖 Write a post about it
🤖 Come up with a title
We clearly explain the role of our agent, and its goal, and adding a backstory also helps with it playing as we would like. 

We define three tasks and assign each of them to an agent. Each task needs:
📝 description: A concise description of what needs to be done
👤 agent: Which agent is responsible for it
🏁 expected_output: The output we would like to receive

Putting all the Agents and Tasks together,
Next, let's kick off! 🚀

The Agents 🕵️‍♂️ read through the research paper "Attention is All You Need", and came up with a title 📝 and a post article for the blog! 📰

I have published the code as a Lightning AI studio,
Everything is ready for you to see and run,
and you can use free resources.
